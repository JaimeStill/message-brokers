# Experiments

The experiments captured in this directory are intended to test ideas and develop a deeper understanding of concepts.

* [API Integration](./01-api-integration/) - POST a message to an API controller, which will in turn broadcast the message using a MassTransit producer. MassTransit will be configured to use RabbitMQ.

## Future Experiments

* **Exceptions** - Conduct a deep dive on the concepts developed in the [Exceptions](../docs/concepts/04-exceptions.md) concept.

* **Requests** - Establish a cross-service request pipeline using the concepts developed in the [Requests](../docs/concepts/05-requests.md) concept.
